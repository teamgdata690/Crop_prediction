# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System for Improving Crop Yeild

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning pipeline to:
1. **Classify soil nutrient levels** to assess soil health.
2. **Predict crop yield** using regression models based on soil conditions.

The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for farmers, agronomists, and agricultural planners by providing accurate predictions and soil recommendations.

## 🌍 Data Sources

The project uses a combination of soil and crop datasets from global and national sources:

- **USDA Crop Data** – [https://www.nass.usda.gov/Data_and_Statistics/](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Data_and_Statistics/)
- **USDA Soil Survey** - [https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/app/](https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/app/)


Data includes:
- Soil characteristics (State, Year, pH, organic matter, texture, etc.)
- Crop information (State, Year, crop type, yield, etc.)

## 🧪 Methods

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed nulls and outliers using **IQR-based** and later **group-based imputation** methods.
- Standardized column names and units across multiple datasets.
- Created new features such as **soil fertility class** and **soil texture** based on thresholds.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots, heatmaps, line charts, and boxplots to identify trends and relationships.
- Fertility and texture classification based on scientific thresholds.
- Regional and crop-wise yield comparison.

### 🔹 Machine Learning Models

#### 1. **Soil Nutrient Classification (Classification)**
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

#### 2. **Crop Yield Prediction (Regression)**
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGBoost Regressor
- Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score
